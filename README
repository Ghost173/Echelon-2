Echelon v.2 is a Big Brother Bot project that it is currently under development. Echelon is a web investigation tool for B3 administrators to study detailed statistics and other helpful information: about the B3 bot; game server clients; and admins. Echelon v.2 is not all about just inspecting information, it is also about interacting with the B3 bot; the gameserver; and the B3 MySQL databse.
